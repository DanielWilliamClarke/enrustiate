# Enrustiate

Just a quick challenge to myself, to see if I could implement a numbers to words CLI tool in Rust in an evening.

## Challenge aims

- Robust input validation
- Render numbers up to a million in words
- Implement the algorithm in the most elegant way possible

## Next steps

- Render numbers up to a trillion
- Tests!!
