# tone_gen

A small tool to generate Chord patterns to practice with as a learning tool for my guitar lessons, to learn where the notes are located on the guitar.

This tool outputs `total * length` chord patterns:

Each Chord is comprised of:

`<String number>: <note> <chord family>`

Example:

```bash
ðŸŽ¸ðŸŽ¸ðŸŽ¸ Generating Chords ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶

ðŸŽ¼ 6: Gâ™® Minor -> 6: Bâ™® Seven -> 5: Gâ™­ Seven -> 6: Eâ™® Minor

ðŸŽ¼ 6: Gâ™­ Major -> 6: Aâ™® Seven -> 5: Fâ™­ Major -> 6: Dâ™® Major

ðŸŽ¼ 6: Bâ™® Minor -> 6: Aâ™® Major -> 6: Câ™® Minor -> 6: Câ™® Seven

ðŸŽ¼ 6: Aâ™­ Minor -> 5: Aâ™® Minor -> 5: Câ™­ Major -> 5: Eâ™® Seven

ðŸŽ¼ 5: Eâ™® Minor -> 5: Fâ™­ Major -> 6: Gâ™­ Major -> 6: Fâ™® Seven

ðŸŽ¼ 6: Gâ™­ Major -> 5: Fâ™­ Major -> 5: Dâ™­ Major -> 5: Dâ™­ Minor

ðŸŽ¼ 6: Bâ™® Seven -> 6: Câ™­ Seven -> 5: Aâ™­ Minor -> 6: Câ™® Seven

ðŸŽ¼ 5: Aâ™® Minor -> 5: Fâ™® Major -> 6: Dâ™­ Seven -> 6: Aâ™® Seven

ðŸŽ¼ 5: Câ™­ Minor -> 5: Aâ™­ Seven -> 5: Fâ™® Minor -> 5: Fâ™® Major

ðŸŽ¼ 6: Dâ™® Seven -> 6: Bâ™® Seven -> 6: Fâ™­ Major -> 6: Gâ™® Major
